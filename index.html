                Where I consider my home is a great question. I moved around a lot as a kid so home is a very interesting topic for me. I was born in Grapevine, Texas, right between Dallas and Fort Worth. But I only lived there for about 2 years before moving to Seattle, Washington, where I spent my preschool years...

            <h2>"What is sustainability"</h2>
            <p>Posted on <time datetime="2024-02-23">February 23, 2024</time> by Collin Easley</p>
            <p>So the quote I am responding to for chapter one is  "Humans have already overshot Earth’s carrying capacity and are living by depleting its natural capital and overfilling its waste sinks." (Roberton, 2021). This to me is a critical issue and one of the defining issues of the 21st century. Professor Strange always highlights the sheer population change that took place from the times she remembers to the world populations now. To me this is alarming and i  can see the sentiment of people about overcrowding across the world. From my home metro Tampa you can often hear people about the sheer amount of people that are moving here from other overcrowded places and this isnt even the most overpopulated country in the world. Although this is sort of an isolated case the effects of this go deep. I look at the American west and the Hoover dam as pictured above. You can see that the water is extremely depleted. According to the New York Times “ the Hoover Dam has fallen 158 feet to 1,041 feet”( Choi-Schagrin, 2022).
This dam is responsible for hydroelectric power for Las Vegas and the west coast and the river it is connected to is the main source for drinking water as well. When i heard this quote from this chapter it immediately thought of this problem the west coast of the usa is going to need to address in the near future.

          <h2>"Biosphere"</h2>
          <p>Posted on <time datetime="2024-02-23">February 23, 2024</time> by Collin Easley</p>
          <p>The quote from Chapter 3 of "Sustainability Principles and Practice" by Robertson (2021), stating, "The realization that Earth is a self-regulating system has had benefits and disadvantages,"(Roberton, 2021) is something I want to respond to. To me this has me thinking about how true this statement really is. Earth can be a beautiful wonderful place but it can also be a cruel heartless place. But at the end going back to the authors point there is some equalibrum. To illustrate this look and the two photos above. One is taken by me at Torres del Paine national park in Patagonia, Chile. When I visited it was one of the most amazing places i ever been, just stunning from the deep blue water to the majestic peaks. The other photo is of the destruction by hurricane Ian in 2022. To me this is the perfect way to illustrate the contrast of earth and the eqaulium it brings. It has its stunning beauty which makes people want to preserve and protect the environment. But if there is a disturbance it causes earth to bring in natural disasters like hurricanes to shake up the established environmental order. The earth's system is in a way a call to action by humans to correct some of our wrongs and be more sustainable. In more simple words the earth's self regulation system is a parenting mechanism to make sure humans behave. </p>

          <h2>"Human sphere" </h2>
          <p>Posted on <time datetime="2024-02-23">February 23, 2024</time> by Collin Easley</p>
          <p>For this Journal I will respond to "Some people assert that human population growth is the sole environmental problem affecting the planet.". Before reading this chapter and taking my assessment I thought I was environmentally friendly. By living close to my work and school I often walk to my daily activities so I thought I wasn't that bad. But as you see above, my real impact on the environment is quite shocking. I think of many people even in my personal life that commute hours to work and eat processed foods all day. How many earths they would need to keep up their lifestyle. In fact, according to the UCAR center of science education “ Worldwide, the average person produces about four tons of carbon dioxide each year. In the United States, each person produces about 16 tons of carbon dioxide each year” (UCAR). This goes that the lifestyle of the average American is unsustainable. So let's go back to the question: are humans the sole factor in environmental problems? From my understanding of the book it's more complicated than that. Human population growth is a significant problem affecting the planet but it is not the sole cause.  It is a complex situation that has many factors. If we focus on sustainable practices this issue of population growth can be handled, so this shows its not the sole factor.</p>

          <h2>"Climate"</h2>
          <p>Posted on <time datetime="2024-02-23">February 23, 2024</time> by Collin Easley</p>
          <p>So the quote I will respond to is "Some observers believe that predictions of climate impact do not take human adaptability into account, and so climate impacts tend to be overestimated.” (Robinson, 2017). Lets dive deeper into this quote. This quote essentially says that a lot of policy makers and scientists might overestimate the willingness for societies to actually take a step forward to combat climate change. So let's look at some data before diving into my results. According  to Rebecca Hershers 2023 article “Nearly 3 in 4 people said that climate change is hurting people in the U.S.” (Hershers, NPR, 2023). This is a key data point to the sediment of what Americans think about this. Well this might sound good for the prospect of combating climate change. The question is will Americans actually take the steps in their day to day lives to actually combat this. In my case I realized my carbon footprint is quite significant. Sitting at 19.85 metric tons of CO2 emotions. This is a shocking stat. But I thought deeper about it relating to the quotes I chose. Would I really be able to adapt? Honestly as of right now probably not. Not that I don't care, it would just make my life a lot more inconvenient to the point that my chances of changing are very low. That makes me a microcosm of</p>

          <h2>"Water"</h2>
          <p>Posted on <time datetime="2024-02-23">February 23, 2024</time> by Collin Easley</p>
          <p>The quote I will respond to is “ It takes 10 to 100 million years for the biosphere  to recover from an extinction”(Robinson, 2017). To me this is mind boggling. It really goes to show the reasilance of the biosphere. Just the vast amount of time for it to recover is epic. Recovery period for the biosphere is extensive. This quote really underlines the complex intricacies of ecological systems. Above is a picture of sue the dinosaur from  the field museum in Chicago. It is estimated according to Barbara Whittneys Jan 2024 article the fossils were apparently “The fossil was dated to approximately 67 million years ago.’ (Whitney, Britantica.com, 2024). This goes to show how long the biosphere really takes for the biosphere to recover. At first when I read this quote I didn't think much of it but then I realized the sheer impact this can have especially relating to climate change. That is how permanent what we do today can last.So with this information this should inspire us to really make a change before making a permanent impact on our environment for our waste doesnt turn into sue the dinosaur.  This can be done by finding ways to more efficiently dispose of our waste to make it depose quicker.  </p>

          <h2>"Ecosystem and Habitat"</h2>
          <p>Posted on <time datetime="2024-02-23">February 23, 2024</time> by Collin Easley</p>
          <p>I will respond to the quote "When streams are not in pipes and are allowed to flow, they are active systems that inherently seek their own dynamic equilibrium" (Robinson, 2017). This gives us an insight into the behavior of streams. This quote plays to the theme of earth having an equilibrium. Streams strive for equilibrium due to the principles of ecology. Emphasizing the interconnections of systems. This means that there is a relationship of various factors from flow rates to what grows in a natural enviroment.  Above is a photo of the Mississippi river and the interconnectivity of the tributaries that shows an equilibrium that it is all leading to the gulf of mexico. I find this as an interesting example of what is said in the quote that even in the big river and tributary system the quote is still relevant. This reminds of my childhood memories when I visited family in Wyoming and South Dakota where I would float off these rapids so that they always had a flow rate that would reach some equilibrium. I think of the water flowing in one direction where it would whizz over my head then it contrasted with the calm eddies. It was truly like a dance of energies trying to relate to what the quote says about water seeking equilibrium. </p>
